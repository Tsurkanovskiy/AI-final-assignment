A CNN trained on CIFAR-10 with use of Keras and TensorFlow

train.py trains CNN on CIFAR-10 dataset and then saves resulting model as file with name my_model.h5

predict.py reads data from 32x32 jpg and by using my_model.h5 tries to predict what object from list of 10 stored CIFAR-10 dataset is on the image

jpg files are stored here just for convenience and contain images from both CIFAR-10 dataset and internet
